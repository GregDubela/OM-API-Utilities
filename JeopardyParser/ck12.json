enthalpy of formation: The heat required to form one mole of a substance from its elements at standard temperature and pressure.
Hess's Law: If multiple reactions are combined, the enthalpy of the combined reaction is equal to the sum of all the individual enthalpies.
spontaneous event: A change that occurs without outside inference; does not relate to rate of a reaction.
non-spontaneous event: A change that will only occur with outside inference.
ionization: A special type of dissociation reaction where a molecule ionizes in water to produce H^+ cations and the anion. Ionization reactions are specific to acids.
entropy: A measure of the disorder of a system.
Gibbs free energy: The maximum energy available to do useful work.
